						<p>Hello, my name is Seth! I am a technical support specialist with years of experience in handling over-the-phone and instant messaging support for technical issues. I have a strong background in customer service and strive to provide the best customer interaction experience possible while working towards a resolution. If I had to classify my skill sets, I would consider myself a "Jack-of-all-trades"; having multiple skills is a highly-desired trait in today's markets, but I believe that it's wise to invest in skills for a focused career path. I am very comfortable with my current skills and I am always looking to improve them. If you'd like to know more details about what I have to offer, please see the "Specialties" section below.</p>
						<br />
            <p>I am always interested in a challenge! If you have a project that you'd like assistance with and you feel I may be of service, please reach out to me at any time (my contact details can be found at the bottom of this page).</p>

			    <p>"Starbound: The Nightars (race mod)"</p>
		    </blockquote>
			  <p>Starbound is an extraterrestrial sandbox adventure game. Chucklefish Games, the developers of Starbound, have made it possible for its players to build and take part in custom content for the game. Custom assets are created using JSON and Lua scripting, both of which are versatile and easy to use. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for people to read and write, as well as easy for machines to parse and generate. As its name implies, JSON is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language. JSON itself is a text format that is completely language-independent, but it also uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others.<sup><a href="https://json.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">[What is JSON?]</a></sup></p>
				<p>On the other hand, Lua is a powerful, efficient, lightweight, embeddable scripting language that is used in many industrial applications, such as Adobe Photoshop Lightroom. It has an emphasis on embedded systems and popular games such as World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy XIV, and Angry Birds. For game developers, Lua is almost a requirement due to its fluidity. In the realm of interpreted scripting languages, Lua is not only the fastest in fine-tuned benchmark programs, but also in real-life applications. Its portability adds to its swiftness in processing, and makes it the ideal scripting language for just about anything!</p>
				<p>While this mod is technically a continuation of someone else's project (the previous author of the content had to drop it for real-life obligations), I was able to learn <strong>a lot</strong> about how JSON is structured, and continuously learning about Lua and how it can be used for practical purposes.</p>

				<p>This is my primary project, the Thea RP Community website. While it was done mostly with pre-built packages that required little setup, I administrate all aspects of it. This website serves to network an entire RPG-type roleplaying community, and if you were to take a look at the website itself, you'll see that I've put <strong>a lot</strong> of effort into making it visually appealing. You can get a glimpse of the entire website by following the links below:</p><br />

          <p>Omni Project: Meter Combat System</p>
			  </blockquote>
				<p>The Omni Project is part of an ongoing project that utilizes Second Life as its primary platform. The Omni Project: Meter Combat System ("OP:MCS") is exactly as it sounds; Second Life has a stock combat system called "Linden Damage System". LDS is great for the myriad virtual military communities in Second Life, but not so great for role-playing communities where combat isn't a focal point. OP:MCS is designed to be modular, in that it can be tailored to specific communities on a case-by-case basis. While Second Life's Linden Scripting Language (LSL) is versatile, it is limited in the amount of data it can process. OP:MCS is designed to work around this limitation by using an external database server for larger amounts of data handling, as well as resolving the issue of an in-world script suffering a catastrophic memory failure and losing all data after a reset.</p>
				<p>The first, official project of OP:MCS is the Thea Combat System, or TCS for short. The TCS is a specialized variant of OP:MCS created for use by the Thea RP Community, and serves as the "proving grounds", in a manner of speaking, for developing other variants of the OP:MCS. Once testing proves the system feasable, OP:MCS can be marketed as a customizable system to parties who are interested in a combat solution if they so desire.</p>
